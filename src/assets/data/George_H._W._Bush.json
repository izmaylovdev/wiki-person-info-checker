W. Bush series}}\n'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (born June 12, 1924) is an American politician who served as the 41st [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. During his career in [[public sector|public service]], he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as \"George H. W. Bush\", \"Bush 41\", or \"George Bush Senior\" in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd president of the United States. He is the nation's oldest [[Living Presidents of the United States|living president and vice president]], as well as the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in history.\n\nA scion of the [[Bush family]], he was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] to [[Prescott Bush]] and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest [[naval aviator|aviator]] in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945, then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]], where he entered the [[oil business]] and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics and won election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Texas' 7th congressional district|Texas' 7th district]] in 1966. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], and in 1973, Bush became the [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]]. The following year, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush as the ambassador to [[China]] and later reassigned Bush to the position of [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] but was defeated in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|Republican primary]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan–Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the [[War on Drugs]].\n\nIn [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], Bush ran [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]]. [[Foreign policy]] drove the Bush presidency: [[military operations]] were conducted [[United States invasion of Panama|in Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Although the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a [[trade bloc]] consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and, after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]], along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War [[political climate]], he lost the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nBush left office in 1993. His [[George Bush Presidential Library|presidential library]] was dedicated in 1997, and he has been active—often alongside Bill Clinton—in various humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father–son combination to serve as president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Bush's second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{See also|Bush family}}\n[[File:George H W Bush at Age One and One-Half, ca 1925.gif|thumb|left|upright|George H.

At $220&nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.<ref name=\"msn\"/>\n\nIn the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised \"no new taxes\" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States Presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.<ref name=\"msn\"/> Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.<ref name=\"ea\"/>\n\n[[File:Bush I approval rating.png|thumb|left|Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency]]\nComing at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.<ref name=\"msn\"/> As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.<ref name=\"ea\"/> The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.\n\nBy his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[poverty rate|lived in poverty]].<ref name=\"ea\"/> At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.<ref name=\"msn\"/>\n\n==== Education ====\nOn April 5, 1989, Bush submitted to Congress the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a seven program education legislative proposal with the intent of achieving \"a better-educated America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/272|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation on Educational Excellence|date=April 5, 1989|publisher=George H.
